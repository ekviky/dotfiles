## Inspiration
I'm a self-proclaimed n00b at managing dotfiles using git, so this is a work in progress. I learned/borrowed/stole ideas for dotfile management and osx setup from the sites:  

nice intro to managing dotfiles using version-control  
https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/  

nice makefile to bootstrap osx setup, too  
https://github.com/Overbryd/dotfiles/blob/master/Makefile  

organization and Mac setup; nice bash prompt

a lot of additional ideas
